This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. It's common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching or when components render before data is fully loaded.  Example:

```javascript
//Incorrect
<Text>{this.state.user.name}</Text>
```

If `this.state.user` is null or undefined, this will throw an error.
